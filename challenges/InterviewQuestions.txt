1. Briefly compare and contrast .forEach & .map (2-3 sentences max)

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
    1. Window/Global Object Binding --> It relates to 'this' being attached to the window function it is nested within.
    2. Implicit Binding --> Dot notation invokes the function
    3. New binding --> Use of the word new when creating a new variable that invokes the constructor
    4. Explicit binding --> allows you to use the call back method to pass reference to the "this" keyword   

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
